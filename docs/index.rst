sgevents
========

**sgevents is a Shotgun event-log daemon.**

This project aims to encapsulate the process of polling the Shotgun event
log, smooth out as many edge cases as we can transparently deal with,
and provide assistance in dealing with the rest of them.

Finally, it provides a method of registering event handlers in a manner to
be well behaved in development environments.
